A Gesture-based Tool for Sterile Browsing of Radiology Images

IBM-Project-3941-1658673241

Gesture recognition is a technology that uses sensors to read and interpret hand movements as commands. It is a subdiscipline of computer vision.Gestures can originate from any bodily motion or state,but commonly originate from the face or hand.Current focuses in the field include emotion recognition from face and hand gesture recognition. Users can use simple gestures to control or interact with devices without physically touching them. Many approaches have been made using cameras and computer vision algorithms to interpret sign language.Gesture recognition can be seen as a way for computers to begin to understand human body language,thus building a better bridge between machines and humans than older text user interfaces or even GUIs (graphical user interfaces), which still limit the majority of input to keyboard and mouse and interact naturally without any mechanical devices.
